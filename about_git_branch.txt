Now you are on the feature1 branch.

Check the status of the repository:

bash
Copy code
$ git status

Commits the changes to the feature1 branch.

Commit changes with the message "Created another branch":

bash
Copy code
$ git commit -m "Created another branch"
Another commit on the feature1 branch.

Switch back to the master branch:

bash
Copy code
$ git diff
Check the status of the repository (no changes in master):

bash
Copy code
$ git status
Switch back to the feature1 branch:

bash
Copy code
$ git checkout feature1
Switch back to the master branch:
